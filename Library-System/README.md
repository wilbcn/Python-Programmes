# Overview of Project  

This project served as an introduction to Object-Orientated Programming in Python. I have developed a Library System programme that the user can interact with via the command line. This project allowed me to get hands on experience working with OOP concepts, as well as using new libraries and modules to gain additional experience as I develop my skills in Python.

## Project Structure
/Library-System/src
This folder contains all of the .py files required to run this programme.

### Key Features
- Create a new Book, specifying multiple attributes like its title, publisher, author etc. Then add this to the Library system.
- Create a new User that could potentially use the Library System, specifying user attributes giving it a unique profile within the system.
- Loan books to existing users, and as long as the Book is in stock. Then return the book before 2 weeks, or it will be marked as late!
- Provide the user options via the command line to edit attributes of any class object.
- Programme with code modularity and resuability in mind.
- Ensure all exceptions and potential errors are gracefully handled.

## Key takeaways and future development

This project was a fun way of furthering my understanding of OOP concepts in Python, as well as code modularity and reusability. 

Some next steps include:
- Create methods to save our Book/Users/Loans dictonaries for permanent use.
- Continue to hone my programming skills and look for ways to improve my code readability and functionality.
